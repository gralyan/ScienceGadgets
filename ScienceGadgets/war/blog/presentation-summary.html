			<h2>ISTE Presentation Purpose and Objectives</h2>
				<p>Algebra is an indispensable tool for modeling complex
					relationships between any quantifiable variables as succinct
					equations used in a range of applications from theoretical science
					to practical innovation. Although this abstraction of real world
					systems serves as a very powerful platform for evaluating problems,
					it also provides an unintuitive layer which generates significant
					confusion and anxiety to students unfamiliar with the subject.</p>
				<p>
					The traditional approach to building familiarity with algebra has
					been through drill type assignments which focus on rote rather than
					critical thinking skills. This approach encourages students to
					"become passive receivers of rules and procedures rather than
					active participants in creating knowledge" (NCTM, 1989, p. 15).
					These methods are still in use because traditional strict practice
					with algebraic transformations in controlled problem sets is an
					excellent way to train for standardized tests. Advancements in
					neuroscience however, suggest that long term memory storage and
					recollection is strongly associated with deeply rooted connections
					to other memories (Willis 2006). To facilitate the creation of
					these connections, it is important for students to be exposed to
					usage of algebra in solving realistic problems. This presentation
					intends to share new technology with this core methodology.</p><p>
					The web program of focus is Science Gadgets, a free, open-source
					application that runs on browsers of any internet capable device.
					This program employs constructivist methods of math education by
					guiding students through real life problems in which algebra is
					needed to solve. Each challenge begins and ends with the scenario
					which requires the user to interpret the situation before any math
					is involved. This allows students to create intuitive connections
					to the algebraic principles necessary to solve each problem. These
					principles are introduced and strengthened in context through a
					sandbox virtual manipulative.</p><p> Virtual manipulatives are a
					method of visualizing and demonstrating abstract ideas in a more
					concrete fashion that have been shown to be "effective in
					supporting students' learning and encouraging relational thinking
					and algebraic reasoning." (Suh, 2007, p. 155). The algebraic
					virtual manipulative in Science Gadgets allow students to interact
					with equations and observe the relationships among expressions and
					their possible transformations. The guidelines embedded in the
					gadget encourages the discovery of algebraic principles in the
					context of solving an equation. As the student progresses, their
					responses are recorded and used to interpret their competencies.
					When a competency is fully developed, the student is rewarded with
					the ability to skip the response prompt assessing that skill. This
					individualization allows the student to focus their time on
					unfamiliar skills and serves as an encouraging game-like reward
					mechanism. Participants of the presentation are encouraged to
					explore the program from the students perspective as it is
					discussed.</p><p> The second interactive section of the
					presentation introduces the audience to the procedure of creating a
					problem. Problem sets can be adapted to meet the particular needs
					of each classroom while still utilizing the framework of the
					program. The web app can then be used to supplement existing class
					activities that focus on conceptual understanding and application
					while use of the app at home strengthen procedural skills and
					fluency. Participants of the presentation will be guided through
					the steps involved so they may create problems appropriate to their
					classes as needed. By the end of the session, audience members
					should be proficient in the general use of the program as a student
					and content provider.</p> <h3>Works Cited</h3>
