				<h1>Interactive Equation</h1>
				<p>
					The interactive equation in Science Gadgets was designed to help
					students understand the structure of equations and the relationship
					between their expressions. The traditional method of displaying
					equations is very minimalistic in its depiction of the natural
					hierarchical architecture of expressions. Thus, students are
					required to be very familiar with mathematical conventions and
					proficient in the ability to mentally parse expressions using
					mnemonic devices in order to use the equation. The traditional
					extensive training required to attain such proficiencies requires
					significant time and focus which naturally deters students from
					proceeding in mathematically intensive courses and careers. The
					interactive equation reduces these barriers by providing an
					intuitive aid for students to explore the relationships between
					expressions. Built in resources also allow users to learn about
					algebraic transformations that may be used to simplify and solve
					the equation. Competences can also be saved, allowing for
					assessment measurement and progressive rewarding shortcuts which
					encourage focus on appropriate skills. For more background
					information, please see the <a href="project/thesis.html">research</a>
				</p>
				<h2 id="equation_structure">Equation Structure</h2>
				<p>Equations are not linear, they are hierarchical. Yet it's
					very common for students to attempt "reading" equations from left
					to right because most languages are read from left to right. The
					language of math however, requires groupings of functions with
					varying precedence which may not be immediately obvious with the
					traditional spatial arrangements of symbols. An example which
					demonstrates a few common pitfalls is demonstrated in the following
					equation:</p>

				<div class="Equation" style="font-size: 300%;">
					<div class="in-equation Fraction">
						<div class="in-fraction-numerator Sum">
							<div class="in-sum Variable">a</div>
							<div class="in-sum Operation">+</div>
							<div class="in-sum Variable">b</div>
						</div>
						<div class="in-fraction-denominator Variable">b</div>
					</div>
					<div class="in-equation Operation">=</div>
					<div class="in-equation Sum">
						<div class="in-sum Number">1</div>
						<div class="in-sum Operation">-</div>
						<div class="in-sum Term">
							<div class="in-term Exponential">
								<div class="in-exponential-base Number">2</div>
								<div class="in-exponential-exponent Number">2</div>
							</div>
							<div class="in-term Operation">Â·</div>
							<div class="in-term Number">3</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Problems</h3>

				<p>
					One of which common problem involves the use of the order of
					operations commonly referred to by the mnemonic device PEMDAS. The
					exponential <em>2</em> squared is a group within the product with <em>3</em>.
					This product is in another expression, its subtraction from one. To
					the trained eye, the numbers <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> are not in
					the same group (in fast they are two layers away) and therefore
					cannot interact with one another directly. Their proximity and lack
					of barriers such as parentheses often leads to mistakes such as
					subtracting <em>2</em> from <em>1</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problem is the group that is negated by the subtraction.
					The convention that must be used in this case is that exponentials
					are of higher precedence than a subtraction. The appropriate
					disambiguation of this expression would be shown as <em>1-(2^2)*3</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The last common misconception in this equation is that the
					variables labeled <em>b</em> may be cancelled. This would be
					possible if the numerator was a product of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>
					because the division would be equivalent to multiplication with the
					reciprocal of <em>b</em> and therefore in the same order of
					precedence as the numerator. Since the numerator is instead a sum,
					it is a separately grouped layer than the fraction and therefore
					the <em>b</em>'s cannot be cancelled.
				</p>

				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<p>The interactive equation gadget helps clear up these concepts
					by providing a tangible interface that allows users to visually
					explore the equation's structure. By clicking or touching
					expressions of interest, groupings of contained expressions are
					exposed. Clicking or touching away from colored expressions brings
					you back up the hierarchy. Only one layer is shown at a time which
					allows students to narrow their focus and reduces overwhelming
					mental parsing challenges. Color coding of the expressions of focus
					by operation type help reduce the users field of view and clearly
					distinguish expressions. Let's try an example with the equation
					below:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Click or touch the term 2^2*3</dt>
					<dd>
						You'll notice a few things immediately when any selection is made.
						The selection is distinguished visually, information about the
						selection is presented, and the lower area presents new buttons
						allowing transformations. We will discuss these buttons in the
						next <a href="#expression_transformations">section.</a>
					</dd>
					<dt>Click or touch the term 2^2*3 again while it's highlighted</dt>
					<dd>When a selection is selected a second time while it's
						highlighted the focus is narrowed down to this expression alone,
						exposing it's child expressions as well. Notice that all parts of
						the equation other than this term are visually less distinguished.
						This allows users to mentally set aside everything but the
						expression of interest.</dd>
					<dt>Click or touch the exponential 2^2</dt>
					<dd>Once again, the details of the selection and
						transformation buttons are displayed.</dd>
					<dt>Click or touch the exponential 2^2 again</dt>
					<dd>Now the focus is down to the most detailed level.
						Constants and variables are terminal entities that cannot be
						stepped into and further. They can only be selected to display
						their details.</dd>
					<dt>Click or touch any part of the equation that is not
						highlighted</dt>
					<dd>This allows you to step back up the hierarchy one level.
						This can be done again until the highest level is reached.</dd>

				<h2 id="expression_transformations">Expression Transformations</h2>
				<p>
					One of the vital set of skills in algebra is the ability to
					recognize expression patterns and transform them into equivalent
					forms in order to simplify and solve an equation. The prerequisite
					skill of visually parsing the equation is explained <a
						href="#equation_structure">above</a> and guided by the color
					coding of the parent and child expressions of focus in the
					interactive equation. Along with stepping into the structure is the
					ability to analyze the relationships among the expressions and
					transform them. Let's go through a guided example as a
					demonstration.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt></dt>
					<dd>Since this term is a child of a sum in the highest layer
						of the equation, it is possible to negate it by adding its inverse
						to both sides and essentially "bringing it to the other side"</dd>
