<p>Welcome to <strong>Learning Through Gaming</strong>, a workshop held at the <strong>Tumo Center for Creative Technologies</strong>. This course is designed as an introduction to educational technology for teenagers, but the reference material is freely available to all those who are interested. In this class we will be learning about and creating our own educational games. The focus of these games may be your favirite subject we learn in school, which could then be used as a fun supplimentary resources by future students. They may however, have a unique focus that evokes critical thinking skills through realistic puzzles-like scenarios. The main idea is to encourage intellectual engagement through play, both of which are very important for personal growth.</p>

<p>There are many different tools that would be appropriate to create intriguing games depending on the requirements. Educational games were made well before modern technology came to be and continues to evolve. This course will focus on learning a few versatile and powerful tools that may be valueable skills for future endeavors. Here is a brief description of the main tools we will use:</p>



<p class="tool_description"><img class="tool_image" src='images/tool_logos/java.png' /><string>Java -</strong> This programming language is one of the most popular for many used because it is easily ported to different platforms and can be used almost anywere. Java is found in things as small as micro chips and android apps to as large as mainframe servers. The language itself is fairly simple, but the true power comes from the plethora of libraries available. Even if you never make another game again, you will most definately use a computer in the future, Knowing Java will be a great skill to have no matter where you go or what you do.</p>



<p class="tool_description"><img class="tool_image" src='images/tool_logos/eclipse.jpg' /><string>Eclipse -</strong> This Integrate Development Environment (IDE) is used as a central hub for creating programs. Its open source nature has encouraged the creation of many plug-ins for a wide variety of purposes. Using Ecliple makes writting in Java significantly easier and faster by providing tools that streamline workflow.</p>
