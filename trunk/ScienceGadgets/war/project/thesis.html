				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>This project aims to explore effective methods of explicitly
					teaching the structure of equations to students learning algebra.
					Since the traditional method of writing equations utilizes symbols
					and spacial arrangements to implicitly describe it's underlying
					structure, students often struggle with parsing and interpreting
					these classically written equations. The first part of this study
					allows students and teachers to create and explore alternative
					graphical representations which explicitly describe the structures
					of equations. Based on these designs, novel methods of visualizing
					equations are developed and tested for their ability to
					appropriately diagram and teach the hidden structures. A lesson
					plan has been developed and adapted to each of the visualization
					methods and randomly assigned to students later tested by an
					algebra assessment.</p>
