This collection of tools is meant to be used by educational websites as an interactive learning resource. The goal is to provide the right tools for students to focus on the particular skills they lack. It should be pieced together and configured appropriately for a specific purpose (e.g. subject, learning level etc).

The collection currently consists of an equation browser, algebra manipulating area, and a graphical representation of the equation as a tree of its components. The components may be hovered over by mouse (or clicked on in touchscreen devices) in order to display all the possible changes it can make on the equation as hints. Students can explore all these possibilities in their own direction without being force fed one algorithm of solving particular equations. This freedom to play around with an equation would give students the opportunity to direct their own learning while keeping the proper rules of algebra in tact.

In the full featured example, as long as the program doesn't run into a glitch, it would be impossible to get an answer wrong. A struggling student would just take more steps to solve it, providing a chance to collect assessment data in the background while avoiding the disappointment of getting a wrong answer or the frustration of being "stuck" on a problem. Possible uses of the data gathered would be grade determination or a reward system whereby mastery of a subject would allow the privilege to skip the mastered step.
