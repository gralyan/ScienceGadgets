				<h2>Interactive Equation</h2>
				<p>
					The interactive equation in Science Gadgets was designed to help
					students understand the structure of equations and the relationship
					between their expressions. The traditional method of displaying
					equations is very minimalistic in its depiction of the natural
					hierarchical architecture of expressions. Thus, students are
					required to be very familiar with mathematical conventions and
					proficient in the ability to mentally parse expressions using
					mnemonic devices in order to use the equation. The traditional
					extensive training required to attain such proficiencies requires
					significant time and focus which naturally deters students from
					proceeding in mathematically intensive courses and careers. The
					interactive equation reduces these barriers by providing an
					intuitive aid for students to explore the relationships between
					expressions. Built in resources also allow users to learn about
					algebraic transformations that may be used to simplify and solve
					the equation. Competences can also be saved, allowing for
					assessment measurement and progressive rewarding shortcuts which
					encourage focus on appropriate skills. For more background
					information, please see the <a href="blog/thesis.html">research</a>
				</p>
				<h3>Structure</h3>
				<p>Equations are not linear, they are hierarchical. Yet it's
					very common for students to attempt "reading" equations from left
					to right because most languages are read from left to right. The
					language of math however, requires groupings of functions with
					varying precedence which may not be immediately obvious with the
					traditional spatial arrangements of symbols. An example which
					demonstrates a few common pitfalls is demonstrated in the following
					equation:</p>

				<div class="Equation" style="font-size: 300%;">
					<div class="in-equation Fraction">
						<div class="in-fraction-numerator Sum">
							<div class="in-sum Variable">a</div>
							<div class="in-sum Operation">+</div>
							<div class="in-sum Variable">b</div>
						</div>
						<div class="in-fraction-denominator Variable">b</div>
					</div>
					<div class="in-equation Operation">=</div>
					<div class="in-equation Sum">
						<div class="in-sum Number">1</div>
						<div class="in-sum Operation">-</div>
						<div class="in-sum Term">
							<div class="in-term Exponential">
								<div class="in-exponential-base Number">2</div>
								<div class="in-exponential-exponent Number">2</div>
							</div>
							<div class="in-term Operation">Â·</div>
							<div class="in-term Number">3</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Problems</h4>

				<p>
					One of which common problem involves the use of the order of
					operations commonly referred to by the mnemonic device PEMDAS. The
					exponential <em>2</em> squared is a group within the product with <em>3</em>.
					This product is in another expression, its subtraction from one. To
					the trained eye, the numbers <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> are not in
					the same group (in fast they are two layers away) and therefore
					cannot interact with one another directly. Their proximity and lack
					of barriers such as parentheses often leads to mistakes such as
					subtracting <em>2</em> from <em>1</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problem is the group that is negated by the subtraction.
					The convention that must be used in this case is that exponentials
					are of higher precedence than a subtraction. The appropriate
					disambiguation of this expression would be shown as <em>1-(2^2)*3</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The last common misconception in this equation is that the
					variables labeled <em>b</em> may be cancelled. This would be
					possible if the numerator was a product of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>
					because the division would be equivalent to multiplication with the
					reciprocal of <em>b</em> and therefore in the same order of
					precedence as the numerator. Since the numerator is instead a sum,
					it is a separately grouped layer than the fraction and therefore
					the <em>b</em>'s cannot be cancelled.
				</p>

				<h4>Solution</h4>
				<p>The interactive equation gadget helps clear up these concepts
					by providing a tangible interface that allows users to visually
					explore the equation's structure. By clicking into expressions of
					interest, groupings of contained expressions are exposed. Only one
					layer is shown at a time which allows students to narrow their
					focus and reduces overwhelming mental parsing challenges. Color
					coding of expressions of focus by operation type help reduce the
					users field of view and clearly distinguish expressions. Try
					exploring the equation below to see for yourself.</p>
