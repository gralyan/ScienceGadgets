				<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>This project aims to explore effective methods of
				explicitly teaching the structure of equations to students learning
				algebra. Since the traditional method of writing equations utilizes
				symbols and spacial arrangements to implicitly describe it's
				underlying structure, students often struggle with parsing and
				interpreting these classically written equations. The first part of
				this study allows students and teachers to create and explore
				alternative graphical representations which explicitly describe the
				structures of equations. Based on these designs, novel methods of
				visualizing equations are developed and tested for their ability to
				appropriately diagram and teach the hidden structures. A lesson plan
				has been developed and adapted to each of the visualization methods
				and randomly assigned to students later tested by an algebra
				assessment.</p>
