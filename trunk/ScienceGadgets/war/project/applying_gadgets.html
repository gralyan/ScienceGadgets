				<h2>Applying a Gadget to a website</h2>
				<p>The Science Gadgets are openly available to be used as
					educational tools on any website. Educators are not only able to,
					but also encouraged to use the gadgets to enhance their site's
					potential learning experience. The code is open source, allowing
					programmers to adapt any part of a gadget they wish. The process of
					incorporating gadgets to a site is also made very easy with
					minimalistic effort and expertise required. A simple interface is
					available to create the HTML snippet desired. The following will
					demonstrate this process.</p>

				<h3 id="newInteractiveEquation">New Interactive Equation</h3>
				<p>Use the equation editor to create the desired equation. Start
					by selecting the expression you wish to change by touching or
					clicking on it. When an expression is selected, the toolbar at the
					bottom will be filled with all the relevant tools you may use to
					alter the expression. Once the desired equation has been created,
					you may click or touch the button labeled "Create Link" in order to
					show the hyperlink and iframe HTML snippet and their respective
					examples.</p>

				<h3>New Challenge</h3>
				<p>
					Creating a new challenge starts the same way as creating an
					interactive equation because all challenges must have at least one
					equation to model the system. See above to begin creating a <a

					you have created the desired equation, touch or click the button labeled "Create Challenge"
